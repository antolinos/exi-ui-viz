[EXI](http://exi.embl.fr/saxs) —  EXtended ISPyB
==================================================


What you need to build your own EXI
--------------------------------------

In order to build EXI, you need to have:
- The latest npm and git 1.7 or later. Earlier versions might work, but are not supported. 
- Bower (installable from npm)
- Grunt version v0.4.5 or later (http://gruntjs.com/)


How to build your own EXI
--------------------------------------

Clone a copy of the main EXI git repo by running:

```bash
git clone git://github.com/ispyb/EXI.git
```

Enter the jquery directory and run the build script:

```bash
npm install
```

Download dependencies by running:

```bash
bower install
```

If you want to see which dependencies EXI needs run:
```bash
bower list
```


Build EXI by running Grunt, the javascript task runner

```bash
grunt
```

If you want to build a version where the javascript will be not minified for developing then use the profile dev

```bash
grunt dev
```

Update a package
===================

Using bower one can update a package by typing:
```
bower update ispyb-js-api
```


Using dust (Template Engine)
===============================
EXI makes an intensive use of HTML templates. Dustjs has been chosen as engine because:
1. High integration with Grunt
2. Easy to use
3. Maintened by linkedin
4. Possibility to precompile the template in order to execute them faster


Use case:
- Template can be uses when we want to render HTML within a Ext component. For instance a column on a Ext.grid.Panel object

How to use dust on EXI?
-----------------------

1. Create a javascript file on  /templates
2. The name of the file will correspond with the name of the template that dust will give to the precompiled function
Example: templates/test.js
```
<table>
{#.}
<tr>
<td>
{.count}
</td>
<td>
{.step}
</td>
</tr>
{/.}
</table>
```

3. Run Grunt or Grunt dev. Because we need to precompile the templates we need to build the application before hand
4. Use the template
```javascript
dust.render("workflowstepsection_workflowstep", [{step:'test1', count:5},{step:'test2', count:4},], function(err, out){
		console.log(out);
     });

```

The expected output is:
```
<table><tr><td>5</td><td>test1</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>test2</td></tr></table>
```

Grunt and dustjs
-----------------------
There is a new task on Grunt. It takes all the javascript files on templates folder and it precompiles on the min folder
```
dustjs: {
	    compile: {
	      files: {
	        'min/precompiled.templates.min.js': ['templates/*js']
	      }
	    }
	  }
```





How to configure EXI 
--------------------------------------
In order to configure EXI some modifications should be done on config.js that it may be found on:
* /saxs/config.js 
* /mx/config.js

It allows to use different configuration for different techniques/beamlines.

The format of the file is JSON and it looks like this

```json
{
   "detectors" : {

	"Pilatus3_2M" : {
				"pixelSize": {
						"x" : 1475,
						"y" : 1679
				},
				"sensitiveArea" : {
						"x" : 253.7,
						"y" : 288.8

				"pixelSizeHorizontal" : 0.172,

            ]
         }
      }
]
}
```

Detectors node defines the detectors used as a hash map "name of detector" : <Properties>

Sites node define to which sources EXI will be able to connect. These are the main parameters to be defined:
* name: this name is an ID for the site and will appear when you sign in
* url : a valid url pointing to the rest webservices from a ISPyB active instance
* exiurl : !ONTEST this is pointing to the offline data analysis server set of webservices
* Beamlines
